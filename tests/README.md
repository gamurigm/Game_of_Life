# Unit-Tests
-For running these unit test we are going to use Node.js.
-Note:
For certain functions like `canvasDimension()` or `renderGrid()`, they are assumed to be correctly implemented as they are part of the final front-end of the project. Therefore, specific unit tests for these functions are not included for the moment.

## 1. Testing createGrid function:
## 2. Testing randomizeGrig function:
## 3. Testing updateGrid function:
