# Game_of_Life
Conway's Game of life's Algorithm 

# About 
This game operates on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. 
The rules determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its neighboring cells. 
These simple rules give rise to complex patterns and behaviors in the evolving generations of the game.

## Game Rules <a name="game-rules"></a>
The rules of Conway's Game of Life are as follows:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
