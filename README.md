# Game_of_Life
Conway's Game of life's Algorithm 

# About 
This game operates on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. 
The rules determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its neighboring cells. 
These simple rules give rise to complex patterns and behaviors in the evolving generations of the game.

## Game Rules <a name="game-rules"></a>
The rules of Conway's Game of Life are as follows:

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
For this project you must have installed: 
Node.js
npm

## Installation Instructions <a name="installation-instructions"></a>
To install Node.js on Windows using the Command Prompt (CMD), you can follow these steps:

2. On the homepage, click on the "Downloads" button.
You will be redirected to the downloads page. Look for the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users, and click on the corresponding "Windows Installer" link. This will download the Node.js installer for Windows.
3. Once the installer is downloaded, locate the file and double-click on it to run it.
The Node.js Setup Wizard will open. Follow the instructions in the wizard to proceed with the installation.
4.Open the Command Prompt (CMD) by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd", and hitting Enter.
To verify that Node.js is installed correctly, type the following command in the Command Prompt:

`$ node --version`
`$ npm --version`

Node.js is now installed and ready to use in the Command Prompt (CMD) on your Windows system.
